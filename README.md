<h3>Fixes in 1.3.4</h3> 
(by [rockcockerham](http://www.github.com/rickcockerham))

This will add the y value for each bar segment to a running total. The way it was before it would place the label where it would be if the bars weren't stacked.

I threw in the ability to add x and y offsets for html rendering.

<h3>New in Version 1.3</h3>

* Implemented some new options (useDecimalComma, showMinValue, showMaxValue)
* changed some default values: align now defaults to center, hideSame now defaults to false
* documentation improved
* more examples of usage
